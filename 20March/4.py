'''4. E-Commerce Discount Engine


An online shopping platform provides discounts to customers based on their total purchase amount:

* Above ₹5000 → 20% discount
* ₹2000 to ₹5000 → 10% discount
* Below ₹2000 → 5% discount

Write a Python program to calculate the final amount after discount.

Input:
Enter purchase amount: 4500

Output:
Final Amount: ₹4050'''

amount=int(input("Enter purchase amount:"))
if amount>5000:
 discount=amount*20/100
 final_amount=amount-discount
 print("Final Amount: ",final_amount)
elif amount>=2000 and amount<=5000:
 discount=amount*10/100
 final_amount=amount-discount
 print("Final Amount: ",final_amount)
else:
 discount=amount*5/100
 final_amount=amount-discount
 print("Final Amount: ",final_amount)
