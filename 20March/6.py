'''6. Company Bonus Distribution System


A company wants to calculate bonuses for employees based on their years of experience:

* More than 10 years → 20% bonus
* 5 to 10 years → 10% bonus
* 2 to 5 years → 5% bonus
* Less than 2 years → No bonus

Write a Python program to calculate the bonus amount.

Input:
Enter salary: 50000 
Enter years of experience : 6 

Output:
Bonus Amount: ₹5000'''



salary= int(input("Enter salary:"))
experience=int(input("Enter years of experience:"))

if experience>=10:
 bonus=salary*20/100
 print("Bonus Amount =",bonus)

elif experience>=5 and experience<=10:
 bonus=salary*10/100
 print("Bonus Amount =",bonus)

elif experience>=2 and experience<=5:
 bonus=salary*5/100
 print("Bonus Amount =",bonus)

else:
 print("No Bonus")
