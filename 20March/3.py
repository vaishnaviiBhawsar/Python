'''3. Income Tax Department System

The Income Tax Department needs a system to calculate tax payable by citizens based on their annual income:

* Up to ₹2,50,000 → No tax
* ₹2,50,001 to ₹5,00,000 → 5% tax
* ₹5,00,001 to ₹10,00,000 → 20% tax
* Above ₹10,00,000 → 30% tax

Write a Python program to calculate the tax amount.

Input:
Enter annual income: 800000

Output:
Tax Payable: ₹110000'''

income=int(input("Enter annual income: "))
if income<=250000:
 print("No tax")

elif income>=250001 and income<=500000:
 income-=250000
 tax = (income*5)//100

elif income>=500001 and income<=1000000:
 income = income - 250000 
 tax=(income*20)//100
 print("Tax Payable:" ,tax)
else:
 income-=250000
 tax=(income*30)//100
