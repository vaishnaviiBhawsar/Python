'''2. College Result Processing System


A college wants to generate grades for students automatically based on their marks in an exam. The grading criteria are as follows:

* 90 and above → Grade A
* 75 to 89 → Grade B
* 60 to 74 → Grade C
* 50 to 59 → Grade D
* Below 50 → Fail

Write a Python program to display the grade of a student.

Input:
Enter marks: 67

Output:
Grade: C'''

marks=int(input("Enter marks: "))
if marks>=90:
 print("Grade: A")
elif marks>=75 and marks<=89:
 print("Grade: B")
elif marks>=60 and marks<=74:
 print("Grade: C")
elif marks>=50 and marks<=59:
 print("Grade: D")
else:
 print("Fail")
