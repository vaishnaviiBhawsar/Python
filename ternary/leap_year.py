Calendar System – Leap Year Checker
A digital calendar system needs to check whether a year is a leap year.
A year is a leap year if:

It is divisible by 400, OR
It is divisible by 4 but not by 100
Write a program using inline if to display whether the year is a leap year or not.
'''

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

print("Leap year") if (year % 400 == 0) or (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) else print("Not a leap year")
