'''1. Adjacent Digit Difference Analyzer

A system analyzes differences between consecutive digits in a number.

Write a program to:

Find the difference between every pair of adjacent digits
Display all differences
Count how many differences are even
Find the largest difference
If all differences are same → print Uniform Difference
Else → print Non-Uniform Pattern

Input:
84261

Output:
Differences: 4 2 4 5
Even Differences Count = 3
Max Difference = 5
Non-Uniform Pattern'''

num = input("Enter Number: ")

for i in range (len(num)-1):
    print (num [i =1] num[i+1])
