A shopkeeper wants to calculate bulk pricing for a product. If one item costs ₹n, then cost for multiple quantities can be calculated using multiplication.
Write a program to print the *multiplication table of a given number up to 10 using loops*.

Input: n = 6
Output:
6 x 1 = 6
6 x 2 = 12
...
6 x 10 = 60'''

n=int(input("Enter value of n ="))
i=1
while i<=10:
  print(n*i)
  i=i+1
