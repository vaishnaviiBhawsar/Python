'''1. Sum of First N Natural Numbers
A teacher wants to reward students by giving points daily. On day 1, a student gets 1 point, day 2 → 2 points, and so on. This follows a natural number sequence.
Write a program to calculate the *total points earned after n days* by summing all natural numbers up to n using loops.

Input: n = 10
Output: Total Points = 55'''

n=int(input("Enter a value of n = "))
point=0
i=1
while i<=n:
    point=point+i
    i+=1
print("Total Points =",point)
