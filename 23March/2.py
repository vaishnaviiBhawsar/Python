'''2. Factorial of a Number
In project scheduling, tasks are dependent on previous tasks, and the total number of ways to arrange them is calculated using factorial. Factorial of a number n is the product of all numbers from 1 to n.
Write a program to calculate the *factorial of a given number using loops*.

Input: n = 5
Output: Total Ways = 120'''

n=int(input("Enter a value of n = "))
fact=1
i=1
while i<=n:
    fact=fact*i
    i+=1
print("Total Ways = ",fact)
