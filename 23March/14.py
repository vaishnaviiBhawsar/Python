'''14.Floor Movement System (Elevator)
An elevator system takes the current floor and destination floor as input.

If current floor < destination → move upward and display floors
If current floor > destination → move downward and display floors
If both are same → display "Already on the same floor"

Write a program using if-elif-else and loops to simulate elevator movement.

Input: 1, 5
Output: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

Input: 7, 3
Output: 7 → 6 → 5 → 4 → 3

Input: 4, 4
Output: Already on the same floor'''


current = int(input("Enter current floor: "))
destination = int(input("Enter destination floor: "))

if current < destination:
    i = current
    while i <= destination:
        print(i, end=" → ")
        i += 1

elif current > destination:
    i = current
    while i >= destination:
        print(i, end=" → ")
        i -= 1

else:
    print("Already on the same floor")
