'''5. Cinema Ticket Booking System


A cinema hall charges ticket prices based on the age of the customer:

* Children (below 12 years) → ₹100
* Adults (12 to 60 years) → ₹200
* Senior citizens (above 60 years) → ₹150

Write a Python program to determine the ticket price.

Input:
Enter age: 10

Output:
Ticket Price: ₹100'''

age=int(input("Enter age:"))
if age<12:
 print("Ticket Price: ₹100")
elif age>=12 and age<=60:
 print("Ticket Price: ₹200")
else:
 print("Ticket Price: ₹150")
