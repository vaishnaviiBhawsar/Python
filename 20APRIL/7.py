'''7. Banking Withdrawal Limit System


A bank wants to set withdrawal limits based on the available account balance:

* Balance less than ₹1000 → Withdrawal not allowed
* ₹1000 to ₹5000 → Maximum withdrawal ₹1000
* Above ₹5000 → Maximum withdrawal ₹5000

Write a Python program to display the withdrawal limit.

Input:
Enter account balance: 3500

Output:
Maximum Withdrawal Limit: ₹1000'''

balance=int(input("Enter account balance:"))

if balance<1000:
 print("Withdrawal not allowed")
elif balance>=1000 and balance<=5000:
 print("Maximum withdrawal limit: ₹1000")
else:
 print(" Maximum withdrawal limit: ₹5000")
