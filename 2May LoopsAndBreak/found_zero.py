Zero Detection & Early Termination System

A financial system scans transaction IDs digit by digit. If a digit '0' is found, the system immediately stops processing further digits for security reasons.

Write a program to:

Traverse each digit of the number from right to left
Display each digit processed before encountering 0
Stop the loop immediately when 0 is found using break
Count how many digits were processed before termination
If no zero is found, print No Zero Found

Use loops and break wherever required.

Input:
572049

Output:
Digits Processed: 9 4
Count = 2
Zero Found - Process Stopped

Input:
56789

Output:
Digits Processed: 9 8 7 6 5
Count = 5
No Zero Found'''

num = int(input("Enter number: "))

count = 0
found_zero = False

print("Digits Processed:", end=" ")

while num > 0:
    digit = num % 10   # get last digit
    
    if digit == 0:
        found_zero = True
        break
    
    print(digit, end=" ")
    count += 1
    
    num = num // 10   # remove last digit

print("\nCount =", count)

if found_zero:
    print("Zero Found - Process Stopped")
else:
    print("No Zero Found")
