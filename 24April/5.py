'''5. Count Factors of Number
A mathematics learning app gives practice questions where students must know how many factors a number has. The app should automatically count the total factors of the entered number.
Write a program to count total factors of a number using loops.

Input:
12

Output:
Factors Count = 6'''

n=int(input("Enter number:"))
count=0
i=1

while i<=n:
    if n%i==0:
       count+=1
    i+=1
print("Factors Count=",count)
