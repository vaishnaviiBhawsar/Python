6.Buzz Number Detector 

A gaming system includes a special feature to identify “Buzz Numbers” for unlocking bonus rewards. Whenever a player enters a number, the system evaluates it using a predefined mathematical rule before granting access to hidden features.

A number is considered a Buzz Number if it satisfies at least one of the following conditions:

* The number is divisible by 7, OR
* The number ends with the digit 7

If the number satisfies any one of these conditions, it is treated as a valid Buzz Number and the player receives a reward. Otherwise, the system rejects the number.

Task:
Write a Python program to check whether a given number is a Buzz Number or not.

Example:
Input:
27

Output:
Buzz Number'''

n = int (input("Enter Number = "))
if n % 7 == 0  or n%10==7:
    print("Buzz Number")
else:
    print("Not a Buzz Number")
