'''2. Hospital Emergency Priority System

A hospital assigns treatment priority based on age, severity, and insurance.

If severity is critical, then check age. If age is 60 or above, assign Immediate ICU; otherwise assign Emergency Ward.

If severity is moderate, then check insurance. If insured, assign Priority Treatment; otherwise assign General Queue.

If severity is low, then check age. If age is less than 10, assign Pediatric Priority; otherwise assign Wait.

Input:
Age = 65
Severity = critical
Insurance = yes

Output:
Treatment = Immediate ICU'''


age=int(input("Age: "))
severity=input("Severity (critical/moderate/low): ").lower()
insurance=input("Insurance (Yes/No): ").lower()

if severity=="critical":
 if age>=60:
  print("Treatment = Immediate ICU")
 else:
  print("Treatment = Emergency Ward")

elif severity=="moderate":
 if insurance=="yes":
  print("Treatment = Priority Treatment")
 else:
  print("Treatment = General Queue")

else:
 if age<10:
  print("Treatment = Pediatric Priority")
 else:
  print("Wait!")
